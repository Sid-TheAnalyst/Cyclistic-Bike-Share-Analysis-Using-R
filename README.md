# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis-Using-R
This is an Capstone Project which I have created during Google Data Analytics Certificattion.

## Problem Statment
In this project, I am working as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

## Learning from this project
- I got to immerse myself in the world of data processing, cleaning, and analysis using the powerful R language.
- From the nitty-gritty of data cleaning to the magic of uncovering patterns, I loved every moment of this project.
- I also wrapped it up with solid recommendations to drive tangible results!
